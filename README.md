# PNGCrush.html
Really good PNG compressor web application. It is 2,500KB of JavaScript ByteCode compressed to about 250KB in a self extracting and auto executing HTML file.

Enable reuse by page refresh, sorry but for multiple files it's not setup well, but for one or 2 quick reductions for performance gain, it rocks and does the job better than any paid software!

Source code used: https://github.com/richardassar/pngcrush.js
It is an optimizer for PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files, ported to JavaScript with Emscripten for use in the browser.
